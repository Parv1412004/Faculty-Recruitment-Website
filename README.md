# Database Lab Project

This is the Database Lab Project.  
To build the frontend of this project, we are using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
To build the backend of this project, we are using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL.

## Steps to Run:
Download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.  
Open the project folder in VS Code (or any other code editor).  
Open the terminal and run the following command to install all dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
Set up the MySQL database locally:  
Download and install MySQL Workbench if not already installed, then run the commands from `setup_database.sql` in MySQL Workbench.  

Configure environment variables:  
Open the `.env` file and update the variables according to your setup.  

Start the backend by running:
```sh
node app.js
```
Go Live. It will open in the browser.
